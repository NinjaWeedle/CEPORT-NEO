### CEPORT NEO

An on-calc utility made in C for the TI-84 Plus CE for porting monochrome 83+/84+ TI-BASIC programs to the TI-84+CSE and CE.

Like the original CEPORT, This utility takes Text( and Pxl-related commands from a program and updates their coordinates to look the same on a TI-84+ C Silver Edition or TI-84 Plus CE as they do on a TI-83+ and TI-84+.

Currently doesn't do any porting.
